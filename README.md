## Introduction
- The repository containes cad .f3d files native to fusion 360, as well as stl files. Some of the files are in .iges format that may contain multiple components joined together with specified constraints and appropriate degrees of freedom.
- .stl files can be used for viewing as well as can be used as raw cad file to slice into G-codes for 3D printing. Assembly and joining scheme is described and will be mentioned in this file also.
- Model is to be 3D printed completely all the components needed tob be 3D printed are mentioned in the bill of components with number required.

## Components
- The actuator used in the model is "Orange OT5116M 6V 15kg.cm Digital Servo Motor" high torque servo motor.

          - rest_casing_lid x4          
          - thigh_right x4
- Electronic components required are:        
          - Single board computers (Arduino or Raspberri pi)        
          - jump wires        
          - Breadboard        
          - Li-ion Battery
